# Aggregate services

Defines all the services in the aggregate, i.e. service descriptors and their associated types.
* This jar is used by the system tests to discover services
* To avoid dependency hell when running system tests it should be pretty much dependency free.

## Backwards compatability

Because the jar is not shared outside the repo there is no backwards compatibility concerns.
