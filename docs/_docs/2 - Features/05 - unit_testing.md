The repository comes preconfigured with the following test dependencies to allow the quick authoring of unit tests:

 * [JUnit5 framework][junit] for writing unit tests.
 * [Mockito][mockito] for quickly mocking types and verifying invocations.
 * [Hamcrest][hamcrest] for more descriptive assertions.
 * [Guava TestLib][guavaTest] which contains many useful testing utilities.
 * [Log4J 2.x][log4j] with SLF4J bindings, to allow test code to log.

In addition, each microservice [added][addService] to the repository comes with a bare-bones `TopologyBuilderTest` class,
which can be enhanced to test the service's Kafka Streams topology, making use of:

 * [Kafka Streams test utils][ksTest]
 * [Creek Kafka Streams test util][creekKsTest]
