Versioning of build artefacts is handled by the [Axion-release Gradle plugin][axion], applied in the root `build.gradle.kts`
file. 

The plugin uses [Semantic Versioning][semVer], with version numbers in the form `<Majar>.<Minor>.<Patch>`, for example:
`2.0.13`.  Version numbers are stored as tags in Git.

## Unique version per build

By default, each commit to the repository will trigger a [CI GitHub workflow][buildYml], 
which will increment the patch version and build the project.

This ensures that each code change is matched by a version number change, making it very easy to trace back a 
service's version number to its code.

## Setting the next version number

The [Version GitHub workflow][versionYml] can be used to manual set the version number the next build will pick up:

1. Navigate to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select `Set next version` from the list of available actions on the left.
3. Click the `Run workflow â–¾` button and either enter the version part to increment, (`Marjor`, `Minor` or `Patch`),
   or enter a complete version number to set, e.g. `1.3.19`

   </figure>
4. Click [Run workflow](){: .btn .btn--small .btn--disabled .btn--success} button below.

This will kick off a workflow that sets the new version umber, though you may need to refresh the page to view it.
Wait for the workflow to complete before committing any new code.
