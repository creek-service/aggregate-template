Code coverage analysis is handled by [Jacoco][jacoco] and, optionally, coverage reports can be published to [Coveralls.io][coveralls].

## Code coverage analysis

The repository is configured to report code coverage using [Jacoco][jacoco]. 
A test coverage report can be generated by running the `coverage` Gradle task:

```
./gradlew coverage
```

Combined coverage reports for all modules in the repository will be created. 
Two styles of reports are generated by default:
* A machine friendly XML report is created at `build/reports/jacoco/coverage/coverage.xml`.
* A human friendly HTML report is created at `build/reports/jacoco/coverage/html/index.html`.

Settings for code coverage are configured in the [Creek coverage build convention][coverageConvention],
which can be customised as needed.

## Code coverage publishing

The repository is configured to publish code coverage of tests to [Coveralls.io][coveralls] when the `coveralls`
Gradle task is executed.  

```
./gradlew coveralls
```

This task is executed as part of the default [CI GitHub workflow][buildYml].

If you wish to make use of Coveralls.io for your code coverage needs then you will need to:

1. Create a [Coveralls.io][coveralls] account.
2. Import your new repository into Coveralls, noting the `REPO TOKEN`.
3. Store the Coveralls `REPO TOKEN` in a [repository secret][ghSecret] in GitHub named `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`.
