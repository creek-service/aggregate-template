The repository come preconfigured for static code analysis by [Spotbugs][spotbugs], [Checkstyle][checkstyle] and [CodeQl][codeQL].

## Spotbugs and Checkstyle

[Spotbugs][spotbugs] and [Checkstyle][checkstyle] can be run locally by running:

```
./gradlew static
```

...and also run as part of the [CI GitHub workflow][buildYml]. 

They are configured in the [Creek common build convention][commonConvention], which can be customised as required.

## CodeQl

[CodeQl][codeQL] runs against each PR. It runs as a [GitHub workflow][codeqlYml].
