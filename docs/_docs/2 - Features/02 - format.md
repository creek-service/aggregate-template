The repository uses the [Spotless][spotless] Gradle plugin to standardise code formatting and thereby
minimise PR sizes and code churn due to formatting differences.

The default [CI GitHub workflow][buildYml] will fail if code does not adhere to the required standard.

## Formatting code

Format local code changes before submission by running:

```
./gradlew format
```

## Customising formatting

Spotless is configured in the [Creek common build convention][commonConvention], which can be customised as needed.
