The `system-test` module is the place to write aggregate-wide system tests, i.e. system tests that test the 
functionality of the aggregate as a whole. 

The module comes preconfigured with the [org.creekservice.system.test][sysTestPlugin] Gradle plugin,
which adds tasks for running the tests:

```
./gradlew systemTest
```

...and configured with the [Creek Kafka System Test Extension][creekKafkaTestExt], which extends the system tests with 
Kafka topics support. System tests can seed and input records to topics and expect records output to other topics.
See the [Creek Kafka System Test Extension][creekKafkaTestExt] docs for more info, or the [System tests][tutorialSysTest]
section of the [Basic Kafka Streams Tutorial][tutorial] for a quick example.
