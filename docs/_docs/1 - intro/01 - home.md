The [aggregate-template][aggTemp] repository is a GitHub template repository that can be used to quickly boostrap 
new aggregate repositories, avoiding the manual repository and project setup.

**ProTip:** An _aggregate_ is simply a logical grouping of services that provide a business function 
via a defined api. i.e. An aggregate is a level of abstraction above a single microservice.

**ProTip:** Large organisations may choose to create additional layers of abstraction by creating aggregates of aggregates.

**ProTip:**
Organisations will probably want to create their own template repository from this template, which contains
additional organisation-specific customisations.
