Repositories created from the aggregate-template have a GitHub workflow for adding new microservices
to the repository. This makes adding the boilerplate code for new services as simple as running a workflow. 
An aggregate repository can one or more services. 
Each service is contained in its own directory and Gradle subproject.

## Adding services

Services can be added using a [GitHub workflow][addServiceWf] at any time. Follow:

1. To add a service, navigate to the `Actions` tab in your GitHub repository.
2. Select `Add service module` from the list of available actions on the left
   {% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-add-service-workflow.png" alt="Add new service module workflow" %}
3. Click the `Run workflow â–¾` button and enter the name of your new service.
   {% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-add-service.png" alt="Add service module" %}

   **Note:** Service names must be lowercase. Only alphanumerics and dashes supported.
   {: .notice--warning}

   **ProTip:** End your service names with `-service` to make it clear the module contains a microservice.
   {: .notice--info}
4. Click the [Run workflow](){: .btn .btn--small .btn--disabled .btn--success} button below the service name you entered.

This will kick off a workflow that adds a new module containing the boilerplate code for a new service, 
though you may need to refresh the page to view it.

The workflow will create a PR containing the new service's module:

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/creek-new-service-pr.png" alt="Pull Request adding new service" %}

Once the workflow is complete, review and merge the PR.
Once merged, the new service is ready for you to [build your Kafka Streams Topology][topology] and add [system tests][systemTests].
