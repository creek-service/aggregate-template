# Aggregate template

Intended for use by people wanting to use Creek in their own project. 

Use this template repo to create your own aggregate repos, or as the basis for your own customised template repo for use in your project.

## Modules

The template comes with the following modules:

* **[api](api)**: defines the public api of the aggregate, i.e. the service descriptor and associated types.
* **[ids](ids)**: defines type safe wrappers around simple id types.
* **[services](services)**: defines all the services in the aggregate, i.e. service descriptors and their associated types.
  * This jar is used by the system tests to discover services
  * To avoid dependency hell when running system tests it should be pretty much dependency free.
* **[common](common)**: common code shared between services in this aggregate.
* **[example-service](example-service)**: an example Kafka Streams microservice.
  * You can clone this module to add additional services.

## Gradle Configuration

The template sets up the following, though you can add and remove things to your hearts content once you've created
your repo from this template:

* Multi-module Gradle Java project, including:
  * Code formatting by [Spotless][1]
  * Static code analysis by [Spotbugs][2] and [Checkstyle][3]
  * Release versioning by the [Axion-release-plugin][4]
  * Code coverage analysis by [Jacoco][5]
  * Code coverage tracking by [Coveralls.io][6]
  * Default set of test dependencies:
    * [Unit5][7]
    * [Mockito][8]
    * [Hamcrest][9]
    * [Guava TestLib][10]
    * [Log4J 2.x][11]
* [GitHub build workflow][12], including:
  * Gradle build
  * [Coveralls.io][6] reporting
  * Automatic incrementing of patch version number
  * Jars published to GitHub Package Repository
* GitHub code owners and PR template.

### Gradle commands

* `./gradlew format` will format the code using [Spotless][1].
* `./gradlew static` will run static code analysis, i.e. [Spotbugs][2] and [Checkstyle][3].
* `./gradlew check` will run all checks and tests.
* `./gradlew coverage` will generate a cross-module [Jacoco][5] coverage report.

## Creating a new repo from the template

Obviously, you're free to customise any repos you generate from this template as you see fit.
There will be features set up on this project, e.g. using [Coveralls.io][6] for reporting code coverage,
that just don't fit with how you're doing things. Just remove any bits you don't want or need.
Many are here simply because that's how Creek does things internally. 

Taking into account any features you don't need, you can also run through the following list of steps to
finish off your new repo:

1. Click the "Use this template" button on the main page and follow the instructions.
2. If using Coveralls.io:
   1. Import the new repo into Coveralls.io, noting the repo token.
   2. Add the repo token as a secret to the repo in GitHub:
      * In GitHub, got to your new repo and click `Settings`->`Secrets`->`New repository secret` 
      * Set the name to `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`
      * Set the value to the repo token you noted from Coveralls.io.
3. Customise the files in the new repo:
   1. Replace/duplicate the [`example-service`](example-service) module.
       One module per service this aggregate will contain.
   2. Replace the `org.creek` and associated package names used in the code with your own. 
   3. Search for `ChangeMe` comments, following the instructions.
   4. Replace/remove this README.md!
   5. Commit changes as a PR (so you can test the PR build works, if using GitHub actions to build)
